# week-one REFLECTION! 

I’ve read the course syballus a few times so far and from what I understand, I have to keep a weekly logs of the things that I do/try..but it’ll be online! I logged on to discord yesterday and I'm glad I did before I started a Word doc for my reflection enteries, but I feel like I should keep a Word file too, just in case this gets lost....Discord reminds me a lot of SLACK and it looks pretty easy to use.

**Github**

I've read "Github" instructions on [link to] (https://craftingdh.netlify.app/week/1/github/) a few times and watched the YouTube videos on for this a few times as well... so I hope I'm doing this "correctly". TEST **TEST** *TEST* Now I'm going to "save" and check if the website I linked here works.. 

THE LINK WORKS!!!!!! *small victories* 

Now on to setting up my **Hypothesis** account. 

The Hypothesis set up and intrustions were pretty easy to follow. I briefly went through the course page on Hypothesis. I think I need to read more into it because right now it's a little confusing. My goal for tomorrow is to do a few test tries with the annotation and then post something on the course page. 

I already had **Zotero** download on my work laptop (the same one I use for school at the moment). I'm not super familiar with Zotero as I usually do citations by hand. From my colleaugues, I've heard that it's super useful for keeping references in one place. I did download the Zotero extention on my Google chrome. I'm looking forward to going through this (https://uclalibrary.github.io/slides/tutorial-zotero-intro.html#/) tomorrow and getting familiar with Zotero and tryign to include a reference or two in my "library".

I created a screetcast video on me using the Hypothesis Chrome extension on Amalia's thread (https://twitter.com/amaliasl/status/1245544256212807680). I was having issues just dragging the video (mp4 format) on to this page. So I "googled" the answer.

I wanted to share a screenshot of my progress, but realized I didn't know how to add a screenshot to this page!!! I tried dragging the screenshot over to this page, but it wasn't working so I had to google that too!! 

After a google search, I found this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHbWF1Bvgf4) for including a picture into GitHub. I did upload to my week one page, but can't seem to figure out how to include it to this entry. I'm going to watch the YouTube video a few times...
